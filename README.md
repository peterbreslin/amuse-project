# AMUSE project - Group F

### Research question: Can tidal forces and the Lidov-Kozai mechanism cause a system of exomoons to align in the same orbital plane?
 
- An example of our finalised code with examples of its use is contained in the '**code_with_examples.ipynb**' Jupyter notebook.
 
- If one would like to run this another way, the folder '_python_files_' contains the necessary python scripts for our code. The example script '**example.py**' can be easily executed to illustrate our code and a sample of its results based on the user input. <br />
<br />

A note about our Python routine: 
- The three essential modules that are required to run our code are '_set_up.py_', '_tidal_force.py_', and '_evolve_model.py_'. 
- These can all be imported through the line '_from evolve_model import integrate_system_'. 
- To plot the results, import the module using '_from plotting import plot_tracks_'. 
- **This is all done in the _example.py_ script.** <br />
<br />

Our final data used in the report can be found in the _report_data_ folder. Here, there is a notebook called '**report_plots.ipynb**' which imports and plots the necessary data so that our findings can be easily reproduced.
