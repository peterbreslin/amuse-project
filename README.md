 Research question: Can tidal forces and the Lidov-Kozai mechanism cause a system of exomoons to align in the same orbital plane?
 An example of our finalised code with examples of its use is contained in the 'code_with_examples.ipynb' Jupyter notebook.
 If one would like to run this another way, the folder 'python_files' contains python scripts of our code. The three essential modules that are required to run our code are 'set_up.py', 'tidal_force.py', and 'evolve_model.py'. These can all be imported through the line 'from evolve_model import integrate_system'. The example script 'testing_modules.py' can be easily executed to illustrate our code and a sample of its results.
